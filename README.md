# Port_Sacnner  [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
  
Hii I am Koustav. 
This is a Python script . It is a free network scanner. It is used to discover hosts  on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

### Working Process

During a port scan, hackers send a message to each port, one at a time. The response they receive from each port determines whether it's being used and reveals potential weaknesses. Security techs can routinely conduct port scanning for network inventory and to expose possible security vulnerabilities.
